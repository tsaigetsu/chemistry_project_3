        history: `One of the most popular myths about alcohol is the belief that "alcohol warms you up." It’s often said that drinking a shot of strong liquor on a cold day helps endure low temperatures. This myth has its roots in ancient times when alcohol was used as a "cure" for the cold. After drinking alcohol, we indeed feel warm – this is caused by the dilation of blood vessels, which increases blood flow to the skin.

        However, this sensation is deceptive. Alcohol causes the body to lose heat because blood that would normally stay deep inside now flows to the surface of the skin. In reality, this increases the risk of hypothermia, especially in extreme weather conditions. Despite this, the myth remains widespread, and many people still reach for a drink on winter days, believing it will help them stay warm.`

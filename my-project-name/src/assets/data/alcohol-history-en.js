        history: `Alcohol, especially ethanol, is one of the oldest known chemical compounds. Its production began naturally through the fermentation of sugars in fruits and grains, which took place around 7,000 years ago in Georgia. In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, alcohol, particularly wine, was widely used in both daily life and religious rituals. With the improvement of distillation in the Middle Ages, stronger alcoholic beverages, such as vodka and brandy, began to be produced.

        Uses of alcohol:
        Food industry – Alcohol is a key ingredient in alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, vodka). It is also used as a preservative and for the production of extracts (e.g., vanilla).

        Medicine – Ethanol is used for disinfection, both in hospitals and for cleaning wounds. Additionally, alcohol is used in the production of medicinal tinctures and preparations that aid digestion or alleviate joint pain.

        Cosmetics – Alcohol is an ingredient in many cosmetics, including perfumes, tonics, and cleansing products, due to its disinfecting properties and rapid evaporation.

        Alcohol, therefore, has a wide range of uses, from traditional beverages to medicine and cosmetics.`
